To make chess moves, this game employs AI 'Alpha-beta pruning' algorithms. ChessEngine.py contains the game logics, while ChessAi contains the ai pruning algorithm, which is used to prune moves that are unlikely to result in a win.
At the start of the game, you can select a difficulty level from 1 to 3.
The final outcome is either 'checkmate' or 'stalemate.' 
You can only move pieces in highlighted squares determined by the validmoves function.
You can also undo your actions and restart the game.
